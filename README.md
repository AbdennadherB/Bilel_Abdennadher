## 🧠 About Me

I'm a computational scientist specialized in **photonics** and **mechanical engineering**, with a passion for applying modeling techniques to diverse systems and challenges.

Right now, I'm working on a **data-driven optimization project** involving **stretchable photonic materials**. My work focuses on implementing the **Generalized Harvey–Shack statistical model** and validating it through **experimental data analysis**.

Interested in **method development** in photonics or mechanics?  
🚀 Let’s connect — I’m always open to meaningful collaboration.

When I'm not simulating:

- 🧳 I'm likely **traveling** and discovering new places
- 🎶 I enjoy **playing music** and jamming with friends
- 🔭 I love **stargazing** and diving into anything **astronomy**-related
- ⛰️ And whenever I can, I'm hiking to the **peaks of Swiss mountains**
